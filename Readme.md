# Nginx caching proxy

A simple frontend for caching requests to an upstream source. This is a custom-built Nginx with modules statically linked in. The VTS module is included for live metrics.

## Volumes

| Path   | Description                 |
| ------ | --------------------------- |
| /cache | Store nginx cache data here |

## Endpoints

The container includes VTS metrics module and the default `nginx.conf` includes a path
that exposes live metrics.

| URL     |              |
| ------- | ------------ |
| /status | Live metrics |

## Purging

This module has cache purging enable with no restrictions on IP range. To purge the cache use the `PURGE` method with a wildcard.

    curl -X PURGE -D â€“ "https://www.example.com/*"
